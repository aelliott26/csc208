# Question 5

## An anagram of a word is just a rearrangement of its letters. How many different anagrams of “troublemakings” are there?
- The answer to this is 87,178,291,200
- To get to this answer we must first understand that the arrangement of the letters does not matter, as we are not trying to create actual words.
- Due to there being no repeated letters, it is simply $15!$
- $15!=$ 87,178,291,200
