# Question 5

## An anagram of a word is just a rearrangement of its letters. How many different anagrams of “troublemakings” are there?
- The answer to this is 87,178,291,200
- To get to this answer we must first understand that the arrangement of the letters does not matter, as we are not trying to create actual words.
- Due to not having any repeat letters in *troublemakings* we are only dividing by 1!
- This leaves us with $\frac{15!}{1!}$ 
- $\frac{15!}{1!} =$ 87,178,291,200
