# Problem 4

## How many integer solutions are there to the equation 
$x + y + z = 11$

### a. x, y, and z are all positive?

- This can be solved using the sticks and stones method mentioned in the chapter.
- We have 11 identical items to distribute among 3 containers.
- To make them all positive they need at least a 1 in all of them
- If we put 1 item in each container, $11-3=8$ are left to distribute
- The sticks and stones formula for identical items among distinct containers is $(n+k-1)$ choose $(k-1)$
- Using the sticks and stones method the number of ways to do this is $(8+3-1)$ choose $(3-1)$ 
- This leaves us with 10 choose 2 which is equal to **45**


### b. x, y, and z are all non-negative?
- Now that they do not have to be positive, we do not need to place a 1 in them all
- Using the sticks and stones formula for identical items among distinct containers we get
- $(11+3-1)$ choose $(3-1)$
- This gives us 13 choose 2 which equals **78**

### c. x, y, and z are all greater than or equal to -3.
- To solve this what we do is we make an equation
- $x=x'-3$ and $y=y'-3$  and $z=z'-3$ this makes it non-negative
- $(x'-3)+(y'-3)+(z'-3)=11$
- This leaves us with $x+y+z=20$
- Now we have $(20+3-1)$ choose $(3-1)$
- This symplifies down to 22 choose 2 which equals **231**

### Theorem one
- For any pair of positive integers n and k, the number of k-tuples of positive integers whose sum is n is equal to the number of (k − 1)-element subsets of a set with n − 1 elements.
### Theorem two
- For any pair of positive integers n and k, the number of k-tuples of non-negative integers whose sum is n is equal to the number of multisets of size k − 1 taken from a set of size n + 1, or equivalently, the number of multisets of size n taken from a set of size k, and is given by ${n+k-1}\choose{k-1}$

- Theorem one can be restated in terms of Theorem two, because the requirement that each variable be positive can be imposed by shifting each variable by −1, and then requiring only that each variable be non-negative.
