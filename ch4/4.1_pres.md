# Additional Exercise 4

---
Write out the first few terms of the sequence given by $a_1 = 3$; $a_n = 2a_n-1 + 4$.  Then find a recursive definition for the sequence $10,24,52,108, \dots$
---

### First Few Terms
- $a_1 = 3$
- $a_2 = 2(3) + 4 = 10$
- $a_3 = 2(10) + 4 = 24$
- $a_4 = 2(24) + 4 = 52$
- $a_5 = 2(52) + 4 = 108$

### Second Sequence 
- First we should find the difference between the elements.
    - $24-10=14$
    - $52-24=28$
    - $108-52=56$
- Now that we can see it is doubling, we can have a clue to the recursive definition $a_n = 2a_n-1 + k$
- To find K we can plug in some numbers $52=2(24)+k \Rightarrow 52=48+k \Rightarrow 4=k$
- Now we know the recursive definition is $a_1 = 10$ & $a_n = 2a_n-1 + 4$ 
- This is the same definition as above, only with a different starting point.
