# 4.2 Practice Problem 1

## Consider the recurrance relation $a_n = a_{n-1} + 9$ .

### A. Find the first five terms of the sequence defined by the recurrence relation and initial condition $a_0 = 16$
The first five terms of this sequence if $a_0$ = 16$ are as follows:
- 16
- 25
- 34
- 43
- 52

### B. Find the closed formula for the sequence defined by the recurrence relation and initial condition $a_0 = 16$
- We can see it increases by 9 everytime so we can determine that $a_n = 9n+k$
- It starts at 16 so we can determine that $k=16$
- The closed formula for this is $a_n = 9n+16$

### C. Find the first five terms of another sequence, also defined by the same recurrence relation but this time with initial condition $a_0 = 3$.
The first five terms of this sequence if $a_0$ = 3$ are as follows:
- 3
- 12
- 21
- 30 
- 39

### D. Find the closed formula for the sequence defined by the recurrence relation and initial condition $a_0 = 16$
- We can see it increases by 9 everytime so we can determine that $a_n = 9n+k$
- It starts at 3 so we can determine that $k=3$
- The closed formula for this is $a_n = 9n+3$
