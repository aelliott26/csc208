# Section 1.5 Proofs aboud Discrete Structures.

## Summary
- To create a fully fleshed out proof we need to just the scaffolding but an understanding of the math objects and structures the proof is about.
- Some discrete structures lend themselves to particular styles of proof and some “standard” proof techniques can apply to particular structures.
- We can use two-line notation to describe a function where the top are the inputs and the bottom row are the corresponing outputs.
- Functions always have inputs from a set (called the domain) and outputs in a set as well (called the codomain).
- A relation on a set A is a set of ordered pairs of elements from A.
- Relation is a way to describe a type of relationship between elements of A.
- Relations permeate all of mathematics.
- Since graphs represent a type of relationship between elements (vertices), we can use graphs to represent many real-world problems. 
 

## Vocab
- **Set**: An unordered collection of elements.
- **Subset**: A set where every element of one set is also an element in another, is the subset of the other one.
- **Superset**: A set that encomases every element of another set in itself and more. 
- **Proper Subset**: Where every element in a set A are in set B, however B does not equal A.
- **Injective**: A function provided every element in set B is the imafe of at most one elem in set A.
- **Cardinality**: The number of elements in a mathematical set.
- **Corollary**: The latter result when you apply a theorem or proposition to directly prove another result.
- **Graph**: is a set V of vertices and a set E of edges.
- **Edges**: are two-element subsets of the vertices, and we can think of them as representing relationships between the vertices.
