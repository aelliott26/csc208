# Chapter 1.2 Notes on Implication

## Summary
- The most important type of statement in mathematics is the implication.
- In math we make general claims, but we specify what the claim is about. 
- An example of an Implication is when P is true Q has to be true for the statement to be true, otherwise it is false. When P is false, Q can be anything, and the statement is true. This is because an implication just requires that when P is true Q is true.
- Implications have to be this way because otherwise in mathematics we would not be able to make general claims. With implications we can say that if this then this is 100% true. 
- The inverse is nothing more than the contrapositive of the converse.
- When considering statements with quantifiers, we ignore the outside quantifiers when formating the converse, contrapositive, and inverse.
- Implications that are true can have false converses.
- The contrapositive of a true statement is always true.
- When the implication and converse are true we say that P and Q are equivalent. 

## Vocab
- **Implication**: It is a molecular statement of the form $P \rightarrow Q$
- **Conditional**: Also known as an Implication $P \rightarrow Q$
- **Converse**: Regarding a certain implication, it is the opposite. Using the above defined implication it would be $Q \rightarrow P$.
- **Contrapositive**: Regarding a certain implication, it is the opposite and the negation. Using the above defined implication it would be $\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P$
- **Inverse**: Regarding a certain implication, it takes the negation . Using the above defined implication it would be $\neg P \rightarrow \neg Q$
