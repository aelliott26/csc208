# Section 1.1 Logic & Proofs

## Notes
- To do mathematics, we need to be able to talk and write about mathematics
- The primary goal of mathematics is to establish general mathematic truths.
- A statement is atomic if it cannot be divided into smaller statements
- If it can be divided into smaller statements it is called molecular.
- A statement has to be either true or false or it is not a statement
- A predicate can be made into a (true or false) statement by evaluating it at some constants
- We don't have to be presice when we assume that sentences containing predicates with free variables are intended as statements
