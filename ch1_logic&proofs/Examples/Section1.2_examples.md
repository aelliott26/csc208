# Examples in Section 1.2

## Reading Questions

1. It happens to be true that all mammals have hair. Which of the following are also true?
    - A. If an animal doesn’t have hair, then it is not a mammal.
    - B. An animal is a mammal only if it has hair.
    - D. Having hair is a necessary condition for being a mammal.

2. Give an example of a true implication (written out in words) that has a false converse. Explain why your implication is true and why the converse is false.
If my dog sees the mailman, then he barks. This implication is true because when my dog sees the mailman, he always barks, however, he does not only bark when he sees the mailman.

## Practice Problems
1. In my safe is a sheet of paper with two shapes drawn on it in colored crayon. One is a diamond, and the other is a circle. Each shape is drawn in a single color. Suppose you believe me when I tell you that, "If the diamond is purple, then the circle is blue. What do you therefore know about the truth value of the following statements?
    1. If the circle is blue, then the diamond is purple. ITD
    2. The diamond and the circle are both blue. ITD
    3. The diamond and the circle are both purple. False
    4. If the circle is not blue, then the diamond is not purple. True
    5. The diamond is not purple, or the circle is blue. True
    
2. Suppose the statement, "If the circle is orange, then the square is purple," is true. Assume also that the converse is false. Classify each statement below as true or false (if possible).
    1. The circle is orange. False
    2. The square is purple. True
    3. The circle is orange if and only if the square is not purple. True
    4. The circle is orange if and only if the square is purple. False

3. Consider the statement, "If you will give me magic beans, then I will give you a cow." Decide whether each statement below is the converse, the contrapositive, or neither.
    1. If you will not give me magic beans, then I will not give you a cow. Neither
    2. If you will give me magic beans, then I will not give you a cow. Neither
    3. You will give me magic beans, and I will not give you a cow. Neither
    4. If I will give you a cow, then you will give me magic beans. Converse
    5. If I will not give you a cow, then you will not give me magic beans. Contrapositive
    6. If I will give you a cow, then you will not give me magic beans. Neither

4. You have discovered an old paper on graph theory that discusses the viscosity of a graph (which for all you know, is something completely made up by the author). A theorem in the paper claims that “if a graph satisfies condition (V), then the graph is viscous.” Which of the following are equivalent ways of stating this claim? Which are equivalent to the converse of the claim?
    1. Satisfying condition (V) is a necessary condition for a graph to be viscous. Converse
    2. For a graph to be viscous, it is sufficient for it to satisfy condition (V). Original
    3. A graph is viscous only if it satisfies condition (V). Converse
    4. Every viscous graph satisfies condition (V). Converse
    5. For a graph to be viscous, it is necessary that it satisfies condition (V). Converse

5. Which of the following statements are equivalent to the implication, "if you win the lottery, then you will be rich," and which are equivalent to the converse of the implication?
    1. You will win the lottery if you are rich. Converse
    2. You will be rich if you win the lottery. Original
    3. You will be rich only if you win the lottery. Converse
    4. It is sufficient to win the lottery to be rich. Original
    5. Either you don’t win the lottery, or else you are rich. Original

1. Translate to english
    1. For all x, if x has property E, then x + 2 also has property E.
    2. For all x, there exists a y such that y is the sine of x.
    3. For all y, there exists an x such that the sine of x is y.
    4. For all x and y, if x cubed equals y cubed, then x must be equal to y. 

2. Consider the statement, “If Oscar eats Chinese food, then he drinks milk.”
    1. If Oscar drinks mild, then he eats Chinese food,
    2. If Oscar does not drink milk, then he does not eat Chinese food.
    3. The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement.
    4. You can not conclude anything else about his eating Chinese food.
    5. You can conclude that if Oscar is not drinking milk then he is not eating chinese food. 

3. Write each of the following statements in the form, “If …, then ….” Careful, some statements may be false (which is fine for the purposes of this question).
    1. If you want to lose weight, then you must exercise.
    2. If you lose weight, then all you needed to do was exercise.
    3. If someone is American, then they are patriotic.
    4. If you are patriotic, then you are american.
    5. If a number is rational, then it is a subset of the real numbers.
    6. If a number is not even then it is prime
    7. If the Broncos do not win the Super Bowl, then they won't play in the Super Bowl

4. Consider the implication, “If you clean your room, then you can watch TV.” Rephrase the implication in as many ways as possible. Then do the same for the converse.
    1. In order to watch TV, you must clean your room.
    2. Watching TV requires that you clean your room first.
    3. You will only be allowed to watch TV if you clean your room.
    4. Converse = If you can watch TV, then you have cleaned your room.
    5. Being allowed to waatch TV means that you must have cleaned your room.
    6. If you are watching TV, you have already cleaned your room.

5. Recall from calculus, if a function is differentiable at a point c, then it is continuous at c, but that the converse of this statement is not true (for example, f(x) = |x| at the point 0). Restate this fact using “necessary and sufficient” language.
    1. Differentiability is a sufficient condition for continuity.
    2. Continutiy is  a necessary condition for differentiablility.
    3. For a function to be differentiable at c, it must be continuous at c, but continuity does not guarentee differentiability. 

6. Consider the statement, “For all natural numbers n if n is prime, then n is solitary.” You do not need to know what solitary means for this problem, just that it is a property that some numbers have and others do not.
    1. Converse = If n is solitary, then n is prime.
    2. Contrapositive = If n is not solitary, then n is not prime.
    3. Negate = There exists at least one prime number n that is not solitary.
    4. Truth Value of 10 = True
    5. If 8 is solitary = No because the original statement only talks about prime numbers.
    6. Relationships = All prime numbers belong to the set of solitary numbers.
