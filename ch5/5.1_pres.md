# 5.1 Question 8

## Let $A$ = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, $B$ = {7, 8, 9, 10, 11}, and $C$ = {6, 9, 11}

## Find $A$ $\cap$ $B$ - Intersection (elements common in both sets)

- $A$ $\cap$ $B$ = {7, 8, 9}

## Find $A$ $\cup$ $B$ - Union (elements in either set)


- $A$ $\cup$ $B$ = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}

## Find $A$ \ $B$ - Difference (elements in $A$ but not in $B$)

- $A$ \ $B$ = {5, 6}

## Find $A$ $\cap$ $\overline{(B \cup C)}$ - Where A intersects with everything that is not $B$ $\cup$ $C$

- $A$ $\cap$ $\overline{(B \cup C)}$ = {5}
