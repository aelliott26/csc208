# 5.1 Question 8

## Let $A$ = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, $B$ = {7, 8, 9, 10, 11}, and $C$ = {6, 9, 11}

## Find $A$ $\cap$ $B$ 
- This is an intersection
- This means that we look to see the shared elements in A and B
- $A$ $\cap$ $B$ = {7, 8, 9}

## Find $A$ $\cup$ $B$ 
- This is a union
- This means we add all the elements from A to B to create 1 set
- $A$ $\cup$ $B$ = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}

## Find $A$ \ $B$ 
- This is a difference
- This means we take away all the elements from A that are also in B
- $A$ \ $B$ = {5, 6}

## Find $A$ $\cap$ $\overline{(B \cup C)}$ 
- This can be split into two events
- First take $(B \cup C)$
- This is asking for the union between B and C
- This means every element in B adds to C to create one set
- D = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}

- $A$ $\cap$ $\overline{D}$
- Now this is the intersection between A and every element not in D
- This is asking for all the elements that are in A but not in D
- This is the same as asking for the difference

- $A$ $\cap$ $\overline{(B \cup C)}$ = {5}
