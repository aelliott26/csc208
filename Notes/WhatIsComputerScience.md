### What is Computer Science?

## Summary of Steve Wartik's Post
Steve Wartik argues that computer science, is fundamentally different from the standard sciences, and is more like philosiphy. Unlike scientific theories that are proved and verified, CS relies on mathmatical formulalisms and models. CS has shifted nowadays towards theoretical abstractions, an example of this is Hopcroft and Tarjan's work on algorithm analysis. This shift led to a lack of emphasis on observation and hypothesis testing, unlike standard sciences. Wartik then uses the example of a paper that claimed open-source software is inherently less secure than proprietary software, a claim that is unsupported by empirical data. Finally, Wartik admits that while a mathematical approach is valuable, CS should acknoledge its philisophical nature and integrate a stronger understanding of philosophical thought. 

## Reflection
I think this article is important to read as it helps change your persepctive of computer science. It moves it from thinking through problems as if they were science problems towards math or logic problems. Due to us swithcing to a math class it is important to understand how math formulas and ideas relate to computer science, and this article helps explain how CS has shifted to be more math and model based over the years.

## Who is John Hopcroft
 - A well known computer scientist.
 - He has contributed to formal languages, algorithms, and theory.
 - Collaborated with Robert Tarjan to develop an abstraction for describing an algorithm's performance.
- This abstraction focuses on the size of the input data, to express time and memory performance as a function for the initial size of input data.
- Their work shifted computer science away from measurments and more towards mathematical formalisms.
- Created the Hopcrft algorithm that minimizes Deterministic Finate Automata.
- DFAs are machines in computer science that are used to recognize patters and process input strings.

## Who is Robert Tarjan
- A well known computer scientist.
- He got a bachloers from Cal Tech and a masters and PHD from stanford
- Collaborated with John Hopcroft to develop an abstraction for describing an algorithm's performance.
- He created the Tarjan algorithm for finding related components in graphs.
