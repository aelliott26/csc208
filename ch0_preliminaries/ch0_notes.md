### Summary of Chapter 0
## Key Definitions
- It is hard to put a definition on discrete mathematics or mathematics in general
- If a set of numbers is all real numbers 0 and greater it is not discrete
- Discrete math can ask the range of a function but the set would not be an interval
- A set is descrete if the elements are seperate or if each input is an individual.
- There are descrete mathematical objects other than sets.
- Some types of objects that could be descrete mathematical objects are ***sets, sequences, functions, relations, graph*** (not a normal graph but a graph that represents elements of a set) ***,and many more***
- **4 main topics are:**
    - Combinatorics
    - Sequences
    - Symbolic Logic
    - Graph Theory
- The tools in descrete mathematics are called *discrete structures*.

> Sets
>> A set is an unordered collection of elements
>> 
>> We can collect numbers, and objects in a set
>> 
>> We define a set by saying exactly what elements are members of the set.
>

> Functions
>> A function is a rule that assigns each input exatly one output.
>> 
>> The output is called the image of the input
>> 
>> Functions come with a domain, range, and codomain
>> 
>> A closed formula is one in which each output is given by an explicit rule based solely on its input.
>

> Sequences
>> When using a sequence we are not just interested in the collection of the numbers, but the order in which they apear
>> 
>> There are finite and infinite sequences.
>> 
>> We can describe the terms in a sequence using a table
>

> Relations
>> Relations describe how two numbers are related to eachother in any way.
>> 
>> Binary relations relate two elements.
>> 
>> The formal way to define a relation is a set of ordered pairs.
>>
>> There are a couple types of relations such as irreflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.
>

> Graphs
>> A graph is a type of relation, one that is symmetric and irreflexive.
>> 
>> The points on a graph are called verticies and have sets of edges(lines).
>>
