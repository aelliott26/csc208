# Summary of Chapter 0
## Key Definitions
- It is hard to put a definition on discrete mathematics or mathematics in general
- If a set of numbers is all real numbers 0 and greater it is not discrete
- Discrete math can ask the range of a function but the set would not be an interval
- A set is discrete if the elements are seperate or if each input is an individual.
- There are discrete mathematical objects other than sets.
- Some types of objects that could be discrete mathematical objects are ***sets, sequences, functions, relations, graph*** (not a normal graph but a graph that represents elements of a set) ***,and many more***
- **4 main topics are:**
    - Combinatorics
    - Sequences
    - Symbolic Logic
    - Graph Theory
- The tools in deicrete mathematics are called *discrete structures*.

> Sets
>> A set is an unordered collection of elements
>> 
>> We can collect numbers, and objects in a set
>> 
>> We define a set by saying exactly what elements are members of the set.
>

> Functions
>> A function is a rule that assigns each input exatly one output.
>> 
>> The output is called the image of the input
>> 
>> Functions come with a domain, range, and codomain
>> 
>> A closed formula is one in which each output is given by an explicit rule based solely on its input.
>

> Sequences
>> When using a sequence we are not just interested in the collection of the numbers, but the order in which they apear
>> 
>> There are finite and infinite sequences.
>> 
>> We can describe the terms in a sequence using a table
>

> Relations
>> Relations describe how two numbers are related to eachother in any way.
>> 
>> Binary relations relate two elements.
>> 
>> The formal way to define a relation is a set of ordered pairs.
>>
>> There are a couple types of relations such as irreflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.
>

> Graphs
>> A graph is a type of relation, one that is symmetric and irreflexive.
>> 
>> The points on a graph are called verticies and have sets of edges(lines).
>>

## Response Questions


### What is discrete math?
Discrete math is the study of mathematical structures that are not continuous but seperateble.

### What are the four main topics that Professor Levin says will be presented in the book?
- Combinatorics
- Sequences
- Symbolic Logic
- Graph Theory
### What are discrete structures? Which specific examples are listed in the chapter?
Discrete structures are the mathematical objects that we use to represent parts of the problems we are solving. Examples of these are sets, sequences, functions, relations, graphs, multisets, finite geometries, designs, linked lists, red-black trees, groups, rings, metroids, and POSets
